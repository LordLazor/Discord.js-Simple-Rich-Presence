# Discord.js-Simple-Rich-Presence

Just Copy the Source Code and edit anything you want. There is a preset in the index.js which you can configure manually and easily. There aren't many features but I can add anything you want

###What you need to do:

Create a new Application on https://discord.com/developers/applications

* In there create one and copy the client id. --> Please paste the Client Id in the code
* Upload images in the category Rich Presence on https://discord.com/developers/applications and select them in the code (image name)

- Lastly run the start.bat
